# MinesweeperPy

This MinesweeperPy came to life during a python project in which the goal was to explore python libraries. 

### Features
* Play a game of minesweeper 
* Calculate yout time and check if you've made any progress with Rankings holding your past runs
* Some fancy handmade animations (like mouse higlighting over buttons) which were made only with image manipulations. Because using already built in ones is not hardcore enough :P.  
* Some code / instructions are in Croatian :/, but it should be intuitive

### Requirements:
* Python 3.x

### How do I play MinesweeperPy?
MinesweeperPy was planned to be played localy on a Windows / Linux platform.

Steps:
1. Extract all the files and directories in empty directory on your platform
2. Run "Main.py" with Python 3.x
3. Enjoy :)

### Tools
MinesweeperPy was made with Python 3 using Tkinter GUI(Graphical User Interface) which is a standard python interface and few hours of fun coding :)
